# Anti-Spoofing Detector for Facial Recognition System
*"The best way to enhance security is through facial recognition."*
## Description
Anti-spoofing techniques aim to differentiate between live (genuine) and fake (spoofed) facial inputs. The development of robust anti-spoofing detectors is vital for the security and efficacy of facial 
recognition systems. By preventing unauthorized access and reducing false acceptance rates, these systems can achieve higher reliability and usertrust. Enhanced anti-spoofing measures ensure that facial 
recognition technology can be safely deployed in sensitive and high-security environments, such as financial institutions, government facilities, and personal devices. The domain of anti-spoofing in facial 
recognition encompasses the intersection of computer vision, machine learning, and cybersecurity. It addresses critical challenges posed by spoofing attacks, aiming to fortify facial recognition systems 
against fraudulent activities and ensure secure and reliable biometric authentication.

## Installation
There are few tools that needed to be installed before proceeding.
